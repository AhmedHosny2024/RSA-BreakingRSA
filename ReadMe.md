implentation of RSA algorithm with clind and server and code for breaking this algorithm 

Steps to run the program 

1- run server.py 
2- run clint.py
3- in the server terminal enter the size of the key in bits 
4- write a message to send on clint terminal
5- you will receive it in server terminal :)
6- to run the attacker you need to run func.py last function put the public key as a parametar you will recive d as output
7- to run graphs between (encrypt time, decrypt time,attack time) with the size of the key you only need to run test large n.py
